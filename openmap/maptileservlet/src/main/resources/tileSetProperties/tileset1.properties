# Note that this tileset is contained in the ommaptile tile set
# properties directory referenced in the web.xml file under the
# TileSetDefinitions property.  That's what gets this file read.  The
# ant jar target will package this properties file properly for
# deployment in the war.  You can add more properties files to the
# directoryfor different tile sets.

# The name is the scoping name in the path after the servlet argument:
# http://localhost:8080/ommaptile/tileset1/z/x/y.png gets you tiles.

description=Standard map tile set example
# The rootDir is where the tile set is on your local system.
#rootDir=<path to root directory of tile data>
rootDir=/Volumes/data/st_osm_tiles
#rootDir=/f:/data/tiles

# This example uses the default MapTileSet class, which just looks on disk for files.  No class property needed.
