Example applications that use OpenMap components.  SimpleMap2 is the example you should 
focus on if you want to build up an application using basic components.  You'll want to 
use the MapPanel, which will include an MapHandler and a MapBean.  The MapBean is the 
main map window.  The MapHandler is the application glue, the component that presents 
all components to all others.  OpenMap components have been written to find each other 
using the MapHandler.
<P>
The SimpleMap application is just a bare-bones application of using a MapBean 
and a layer to create a map in a frame.  It seems like this is a good starting point, 
but trust me, SimpleMap2 is the better starting point.
<P>
The Main and OpenMap applications are simple expansions of SimpleMap2, using the 
PropertyHandler to specify components in a properties file.
